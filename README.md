# AI-Flappy-Bird
The game is a clone of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, 
where a bird must navigate through a series of pipes by jumping at the right times.
Instead of manual player control, this project uses a machine learning approach with NEAT 
to evolve a neural network that learns the best strategy over multiple generations.
